# openskin

An OpenCode-style look for the Claude Code terminal transcript, as a Claude Code mod.

- Your prompts sit in a full-width block with an accent bar down the left edge.
- Tool calls, their results and errors get blocks of their own, with a quieter bar.
- Claude's replies are drawn without a bullet, on a background band of their own.
- Shell commands in a reply are framed, so they stand apart from the prose.
- Each turn closes with a footer: `▣ Claude · <model> · <duration>`.

- In fullscreen, a status panel of cards docks beside the transcript: the project's directory, git branch and uncommitted changes with your status line script's output, one row per part; how full the context window is; each turn's tokens; your subscription's 5-hour and weekly windows; then the session's board and summary.
- `/skin` switches every color at once between ten presets (Tokyo Night, Catppuccin, Gruvbox, Nord, Rose Pine, Kanagawa, Everforest, One Dark and more), and Claude Code's own theme with them.

Every color is an option, and each part (the OpenCode look, the command frames, the status panel) can be switched off on its own.

Unofficial: not affiliated with OpenCode or Anthropic.

## Install

At the prompt of a Claude Code terminal session:

```
/plugin install openskin --marketplace nahuel893/refined-claude-code
```

Answer `y` to add the marketplace, then pick a scope (user scope loads it in every session).

From a shell:

```bash
claude plugin install openskin --marketplace nahuel893/refined-claude-code
```

In the desktop app, where `/plugin` does not run: click + next to the prompt box, then Plugins, Add marketplace with `nahuel893/refined-claude-code`, then Add plugin.

## Options

Change them with `/plugin configure openskin@refined-claude-code`. A color is a hex such as `#f0a6ec`, a color name, or a Claude Code theme key such as `bashBorder`.

| Option | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `opencodeStyle` | `true` | The OpenCode look: prompt, tool and error blocks, the reply band, the turn footer. |
| `commandFrames` | `true` | Frames the shell commands in Claude's replies and asks Claude to tag them as shell blocks. |
| `statusPanel` | `true` | The status panel beside the transcript in fullscreen; `/panel` opens it. |
| `contextWarnAt` | `50` | The context fill, in percent, from which the panel's ◔ Context section turns yellow (time to `/compact`). |
| `contextDangerAt` | `75` | The context fill from which it turns the error color (compact now or start a new session). |
| `accent` | `#f0a6ec` | The bar beside your prompts and the square in the footer. |
| `surface` | `#24242c` | The background of the prompt, tool and error blocks. |
| `toolBar` | `#55555f` | The bar beside tool calls and their results. |
| `error` | `#ff6b5b` | The bar beside error rows. |
| `muted` | `#7f7f8a` | The footer's model and duration, and the text of error rows. |
| `command` | `bashBorder` | The frame and label of shell commands. |
| `background` | `#1c1c22` | The band behind Claude's replies; `none` draws no band. |
| `panelBackground` | `none` | The background of the whole status panel, to match your terminal (`#000000` on a black one); `none` paints nothing and keeps what Claude Code draws there. `/skin` presets leave it as it is. |

With `opencodeStyle` off and `commandFrames` on, Claude Code keeps its own transcript and only the commands are framed. With both off, the mod draws nothing.

## Themes

`/skin` lists the presets; `/skin <name>` applies one. A preset sets every color option above and switches Claude Code's own theme to dark or light to match. It changes the same settings `/plugin configure` does, so the mod reloads with the new colors, and `/skin default` brings back the defaults.

| Preset | Theme | `accent` | `surface` | `toolBar` | `error` | `muted` | `command` | `background` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `default` | dark | `#f0a6ec` | `#24242c` | `#55555f` | `#ff6b5b` | `#7f7f8a` | `bashBorder` | `#1c1c22` |
| `tokyonight` | dark | `#bb9af7` | `#1f2335` | `#414868` | `#f7768e` | `#737aa2` | `#7dcfff` | `#16161e` |

| `rose-pine` | dark | `#c4a7e7` | `#26233a` | `#403d52` | `#eb6f92` | `#908caa` | `#9ccfd8` | `#191724` |
| `rose-pine-dawn` | light | `#907aa9` | `#f2e9e1` | `#cecacd` | `#b4637a` | `#797593` | `#56949f` | `#faf4ed` |
| `kanagawa-wave` | dark | `#d27e99` | `#2a2a37` | `#54546d` | `#e46876` | `#938aa9` | `#7fb4ca` | `#16161d` |
| `everforest` | dark | `#a7c080` | `#343f44` | `#475258` | `#e67e80` | `#9da9a0` | `#83c092` | `#232a2e` |
| `one-dark` | dark | `#61afef` | `#2c313c` | `#3e4451` | `#e06c75` | `#828997` | `#56b6c2` | `#21252b` |

A setting that something else controls, such as a theme fixed by managed settings, is left as it is, and `/skin` names it in its reply.

Edits made outside Claude Code, such as a desktop theme script rewriting `~/.claude/settings.json`, reach open sessions by themselves within a few seconds. A session that has stopped following the file (one started before the file was replaced, say by a symlink into a dotfiles repository) gets a `/reload-plugins` from openskin when its colors or theme fall behind. `/skin` writes nothing while the session is behind the file, so it never undoes such an edit: it reloads first and asks you to run it again.

## Status panel

In the fullscreen layout the panel opens by itself beside the transcript (`/panel` opens it anywhere). Every part of it is a card: a rounded border in the `toolBar` color with the card's title drawn in its top edge, the cards stacked with no blank row between them, labels in the `muted` color and values bold.

- **✿ Status**: always first. The project's directory (your home written as `~`); inside a git work tree, `Branch` and, while there are uncommitted changes, `Changes`: how many files are changed or untracked, then the lines added (green) and deleted (the `error` color) in tracked files since the last commit (untracked files count as files, their lines are not counted). Under them, the rows of `~/.claude/statusline.sh`, each ` | ` separated part on its own row, leaving out the `5h:` and `7d:` parts and the context bar, which the ◷ Usage and ◔ Context cards replace. Git runs again when Claude Code gives the status line new input (after a turn, or in another directory) and otherwise every 15 seconds, so edits made outside the session show up too.

Then each card once it has something to show:

- **◔ Context**: how full the context window is, as the status line's ten-cell bar (`██████░░░░ 58% (116000/200000)`, the tokens when known): filled cells in the `accent` color, yellow from `contextWarnAt` and the `error` color from `contextDangerAt`, empty cells `muted`. Before the session's first response it is counted once as `/context` does and shown with a `~`.
- **⇅ Tokens**: the last turn's input (`↑`), output (`↓`) and cache tokens, then the session's running total.
- **◷ Usage**: the subscription's 5-hour and weekly windows, a bar yellow from 75% and red from 90%, and the time until each resets. Every open session shares the latest reading. Off a subscription there is nothing to show.
- **≡ Board · 2 of 5**: the session's board from the [board](../board) mod, one row per item, its title counting the done ones. A done item (`✓`) is struck through and dim, a pending one (`○`) plain, and one waiting on your decision (`◇`) has its mark in the accent color. Long items wrap.
- **¶ Summary**: the session's summary from the [summarize](../summarize) mod, wrapped to the panel's width, never cut.

The last two need those mods. Both write into the session's folder under its project, `~/.cache/refined-claude-code/projects/<project slug>/<session id>/`: `/board` writes `board.md` and `/summ` writes `summary.md`. The panel reads only the current session's files, never another session's. The panel checks both files every 1.5 seconds and redraws a section when its file changes. With no file, or an empty one, the card is left out.

### Feeding the panel from your status line script

The panel reads the input Claude Code last gave your script, so the script has to keep it. Add this near the top of `~/.claude/statusline.sh`, after it reads stdin into `$input`:

```bash
SESSION_ID=$(jq -r '.session_id // empty' <<<"$input")
if [ -n "$SESSION_ID" ]; then
  OPENSKIN=~/.cache/openskin
  mkdir -p "$OPENSKIN/sessions" &&
    printf '%s' "$input" >"$OPENSKIN/sessions/$SESSION_ID.json.tmp" &&
    mv -f "$OPENSKIN/sessions/$SESSION_ID.json.tmp" "$OPENSKIN/sessions/$SESSION_ID.json"
  # Docked, the panel shows the status line: leave Claude Code's own one empty.
  [ -z "$OPENSKIN_PANEL" ] && [ -e "$OPENSKIN/docked/$SESSION_ID" ] && exit 0
fi
```

Once the panel docks it creates `~/.cache/openskin/docked/<session id>`, and the last line keeps the status line under the prompt empty for that session; the panel runs the script with `OPENSKIN_PANEL=1` to get the lines it draws. Drop that line to keep both. To make fullscreen the default for every session, set `"tui": "fullscreen"` in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

## Limits

A mod can only restyle what Claude Code lets it draw. The prompt input box has no hook, so its look follows `/theme`. Rows the engine draws itself (the spinner, system notices) keep their own look.

## Development

```bash
claude plugin test .
claude plugin validate .
```
