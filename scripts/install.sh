Usage: scripts/install.sh [--local] [--no-narrator] [--piper [locale]]

Installs git and Claude Code when they are missing, then the refined-claude-code
marketplace with openskin, command-register, board and summarize, and
better-claude's narrator with a speech tool.

  --local         add this checkout as the marketplace instead of GitHub, so
                  edits apply after /reload-plugins
  --no-narrator   skip better-claude's narrator and the speech tool
  --piper [loc]   Arch Linux only: also give the narrator a Piper voice through
                  scripts/narrator-piper-arch.sh (default locale es-ar)
